# Blink E-commerce

The BARK Protocol, which operates on the Solana blockchain, has introduced an innovative e-commerce solution called **Solana Blink**. This platform is designed to leverage blockchain technology to revolutionize online commerce, particularly in terms of speed and security.

**Solana Blink** is part of BARK Protocol's broader efforts to create decentralized finance (DeFi) and SocialFi solutions that empower communities and facilitate impactful charity initiatives. It integrates advanced blockchain features to offer a seamless, fast, and secure e-commerce experience. The platform is headless, meaning it can be easily customized and integrated with various front-end solutions, making it highly flexible for developers and merchants.

This initiative underscores BARK's commitment to combining financial technology with social good, aiming to create sustainable and community-centered projects that have a real-world impact.

Frameworks: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
